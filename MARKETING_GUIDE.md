2. Create Lookalike Audience (1% similarity)
3. Target lookalikes with ads

---

## 💰 Budget Recommendations

### Testing Phase (Days 1-3)
- Budget: $20/day
- Goal: Find winning creative/audience
- Test 3-4 different ads

### Scaling Phase (Days 4-7)
- Budget: $50-100/day
- Focus on best-performing ad
- Increase budget by 20% every 2 days if profitable

### Profitability Math
```
If your ad spend is $50/day
And your CPA (cost per acquisition) is $4
You'll get ~12-13 sales per day
Revenue: 12 × $10 = $120
Stripe fees: 12 × $0.59 = $7.08
Net revenue: $120 - $7.08 = $112.92
Profit: $112.92 - $50 = $62.92/day
```
